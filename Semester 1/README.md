## Reflection

This semester, I have learned the fundamentals of C++. I have learned mathematical operators, conditionals, loops, inheritance, arrays, and vectors. These theories are the basics of programming in any language and being able to nail them down allows me to learn more complex coding techniques in the future.

In my experience, readings for coding learning are less valuable than actual practical applications. Just because you read how to do something doesn't give you the skills needed to perform the task correctly. I believe learning is far better than reading and/or theories because, in class, we applied what we learned. In many cases in my coding experience, I would learn how to implement a new skill into a program, but when practiced, it didn't work. The nuances that are encountered when programming cannot be learned through words on a page or a screen.

Honestly, I don't think I could've done better with my approach to problems. I am quite experienced in problem-solving, and one of my greatest strengths is reading comprehension. I could read the problem, analyze it quickly, and then come up with a solution that was not only quick but effective. I often considered cases where a certain input would crash the problem if left unchecked, and I made sure my code was the most effective work I could produce. The only thing I would be able to say I could improve would be styling. My code has very little style, and I would say is rather bulky in some spots.

I think one of the most important things I've learned from this course in making future games would be the usage of vectors. My original coding language I learnt was Java, and one thing I missed from it was array lists. Vectors are just like array lists; in that I can add multiple objects to the list and keep a cohesive and understandable list of all my objects.

I believe my learning in this module is different than how most others may have learned. I already know these basics and fundamentals of coding and I have the experience to know how to approach problems correctly. The only thing I truly learned was how to do what I would do in Java in C++ instead. Even then, the two languages are very similar that it wasn't a learning curve at all. The most I learned was the potential application to use this knowledge for games rather than general software development, which I already knew how to do.

## Week 2
### Themes
Arithmetic Operators

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we learned how to use arithmetic operators in C++. A crucial understanding of math and the order of operations was needed to complete this assessment. Effective and efficient code was developed and properly used. The operators used are: modulus, division, multiplication, addition, subtraction.

### Reading
Basic math operators are discussed.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
The further work I put in was organizing my code into separate functions rather than having all of it in int main(). I called upon these functions and accurately and effectively used them within main().

## Week 3
### Themes
Comparative Operators

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we learned how to use comparative operators in C++ in order to make menus and character story quests. This also included the use of if statements, else if statements, else statements, and switch cases. If statements were used singularly and in nested loops. The comparative operators of addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulus were key to creating the programmes.

### Reading
&& (and) and \|\| (or) operators discussed. Different types of conditional statements in relation to loops.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
The further work I put in was making random sequences happen in my character story. Your motive for traveling changes and the damage you do to the NPC is random every time. The damage done to you by the NPC is also random and based upon your own stats depending on the race you chose. I believe the further work I completed showcased my literacy in C++ and similar coding languages.

## Week 4
### Themes
Loops

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we practiced the usage of for and while loops. The code used is like the syntax of java, so the usage of these concepts was not foreign. In task 1, the activity instructed to count to 20 using a for loop and then down from 100, in increments of 5, in a for loop, which was conducted successfully. Task 1 also asked for the implementation of a times table up to 12, which was also done successfully and efficiently. Task 2 asked to make the times table again, but in a while loop. It had to continue until the user inputted 'N' or 'n' to quit. Task 3 was like the final task of last week, especially since last week's went above the requirements. The simple combat loop developed works correctly and efficiently, as demonstrated by the screenshots.

### Reading
Simple loop work.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
I looked up some webpages on how to cast doubles as int in C++ in order to output a whole number to the user, so they don't get overwhelmed by decimals. Since it's a cast, it didn't change the calculations, which were still done with doubles.

## Week 5
### Themes
Functions in C++

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we were instructed to use functions to write our code outside of the main() program to improve the functionality and readability of the code. We re-introduced programs made in previous weeks to make a main menu that has a start screen and end screen, all called upon in main. The menu and all previous programs work perfectly as expected.

### Reading
Functions help make code easier to read.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
I also used global variables such as pi and gameOver as to eliminate the need to declare and initialize them in various functions. This allows me to modify the quality of gameOver easily between functions.

## Week 7
### Themes
Arrays and GameBoards

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we learned how to create and fill arrays along with iterating through them using for loops and for each loops.

### Reading
Array work for game boards.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
In my further work of inputting random letters onto the game board, I made an array with random letters inside and created a loop that filled a random section of the board with the letter. It also included a catch statement that checked if there was a letter already placed in that spot. If that was the case, 'i' would decrease by 1 and it would go backwards into the program again, therefore assuring that there will always be 5 random characters on the board.

## Week 8
### Themes
Classes and Objects

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop, we learned how to use classes and objects. We had to make the object and then declare its attributes. There also were private and public variables inside classes which change whether or not functions such as main have access to them.

### Reading
Classes and objects can make characters and store information to be used later on and continuously updated.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
I went further and used constructors and I attempted to make a list or vector to auto-iterate through the character objects no matter how many there were, but it failed.

## Week 9
### Themes
Classes and Inheritance

### Workshop Activity
In this week's workshop activity, we worked on more object usage. We worked with inheritance, as seen with the NPC and PC classes that are derived from the Character class. We also worked with methods and constructors defined inside and outside the class itself.

### Reading
Inheritance across files.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
No further work completed this week.


## Week 10
### Themes
Header Files

### Workshop Activity
In this workshop activity, all we did was separate the code into 2 new files: A GameObjects.cpp and GameObjects.h. We had to include the header file into the two C++ files so it can reference it.

### Reading
Easier to read and better organized code.

### Further Work / Any other Relevant Information
None.
