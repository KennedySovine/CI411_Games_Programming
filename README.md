# CI411 - Introduction to Games Programming
2022-2023 Intro to Games Programming. University of Brighton, Computer Science for Games
## Assessment 1
Assessment 1 was rather simple as a start to the programming fundamentals. Throughout the year, we were assigned workshop tasks to work on during our labs. After each workshop was done, we were instructed to create a workshop log showing our code snippets, reflections on our reading, and detailing any further work we did. 

For the assessment, we were tasked with compiling all of the logs into one [Word](/Semester%201/CI411_ASSESSMENT1.docx) document for submission.
## Assessment 2
Assessment 2 was much different than the first. Instead of learning more about programming, we were tasked with using what we learned and creating a 2D FPS game using the SDL library and coding with C++, which is what we learned in the first semester.

The game I came up with is called <i>'Prism of Lights'</i>. Originally, I wished to create a vertical-scrolling platformer, similar in style to 'Jump King'. Instead, I had to throw out the main ideas of my game because it was not feasible for me to accomplish and creating a simple retro shooter would be better for the brief.

Unfortunately, while developing the game, I ran into many issues. Textures wouldn't load properly and the game is essentially unplayable after the first level. Fortunately, the assignment was to only make a prototype and log any/all bugs and issues, especially if they could not be fixed.

I created orignal assets for the prisms and found the other assets through online search.
